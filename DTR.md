<br><br>

**Group Member Names:** Nico R. & Travis M
<br><br>

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):** <br>
Nico: Would like to learn how to use Rails efficiently.
<br>
Travis: Would like to learn more about databases and how to create/migrate/etc.

<br><br>

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**
<br>

<br>
Travis: Passion for coding, passion for clear communication.
<br><br>

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**
<br>
Nico: Be able to organize the work, having clear tasks to complete.
<br>
Travis: Keeping communication clear and open, clear expectations.
<br>

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**
<br>
Nico: Try to have a schedule like; 8AM till school starts, after 4PM till 8PM.
<br>
Travis: 8AM till school starts, after 4PM.
<br>

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**
<br>
If someone falls behind, we can support each other. Try to divide work as evenly as possible.

<br>

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**
<br>
Will review each others' code. Sometimes do together. Won't merge own branch
<br>

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**
<br>
Nico: Try to do a 5min every hour or so, otherwise I won't take them.
<br>
Travis: Whenever we need, just communicate it.
<br>
Expectation is to talk through some issues or whatever, but then work independently (not in same room). Both of us work better with no distractions. Unless there are stories that we need quick feedback for.
<br>

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**
<br>
Nico: Open to get as much feedback as possible. Open-minded about areas of improvement.
<br>
Travis: All feedback is welcome as long as it's worded respectfully.

**Additional Remote Considerations:**
<br>
Generally not working in a Zoom room together, but will stay open for contact (Slack(better for Nico), text).
<br>

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**
<br>
Github
